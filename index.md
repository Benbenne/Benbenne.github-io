## Hi there!

I am Ben! I am currently an undergraduate student in UESTC, majoring in Electronic and Electrical Engineering (EEE). During my undergraduate period, I studied both Hardware and Software. My previous research focused on deep learning, processsing of uncertain information and Z-numbers. I am currently searching for a PhD opening in the area related to deep learning and ASIC design for AI.
